      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold ">Google Ads: A Powerful Tool for Online Advertising</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 ">Google Ads is one of the most effective online advertising platforms, allowing
        businesses of all sizes to reach potential customers through targeted ads on Google Search, YouTube, and other
        partner sites. Whether you're looking to increase website traffic, generate leads, or boost sales, Google Ads
        provides a versatile and scalable solution.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold ">What is Google Ads?</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 ">Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising
        platform where advertisers bid on keywords to display ads to users searching for relevant terms. With various
        ad formats, including search ads, display ads, video ads, and shopping ads, businesses can craft tailored
        marketing campaigns that align with their goals.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold ">Benefits of Google Ads</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ">
        <li><strong>Targeted Advertising</strong> – Google Ads allows businesses to target users based on keywords,
          demographics, location, device, and even past online behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Control</strong> – With PPC bidding, you only pay when someone clicks on your ad, giving you
          control over your budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurable Performance</strong> – Track conversions, clicks, and impressions to optimize your
          campaigns for better results.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Results</strong> – Unlike organic search engine optimization (SEO), Google Ads can drive
          traffic to your website almost instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Campaigns</strong> – Adjust campaigns in real time to improve performance based on
          analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold ">Types of Google Ads Campaigns</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ">
        <li><strong>Search Ads</strong> – Appear at the top of Google search results when users search for relevant
          keywords.</li>
        <li><strong>Display Ads</strong> – Visually engaging ads that appear on Google’s Display Network.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Ads</strong> – Show up on YouTube and other video partner sites.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold ">How to Get Started with Google Ads</h2>
